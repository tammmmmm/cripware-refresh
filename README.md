# cripware-refresh
I fixed the UI Lib and changed some other ease of use stuff

## Loadstring
```lua
--ssooaapp
loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tammmmmm/cripware-refresh/main/cripware-UI"))()

```
## Changed menu keybind
Changed the keybind from Insert to End for better QoL with internal SynapseX
